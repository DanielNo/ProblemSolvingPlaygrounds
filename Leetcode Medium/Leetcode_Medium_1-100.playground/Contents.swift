 2. Add Two Numbers
 You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.
 
 You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.
 
 Example:
 
 Input: (2 -> 4 -> 3) + (5 -> 6 -> 4)
 Output: 7 -> 0 -> 8
 Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.

 Attempt 1 without cheating: Create two functions:
 turns a node into a number
 number into a node
 
 create a number with the number creation function and convert the number into a node with the other function
 
 Note - Worked until the input node exceeded Int64 number of digits.

/*
3. Longest substring without repeating character (medium)
Note : Solved again using a different approach (two pointers). Solved with relative ease, two compilations, and off by one mistake and syntax error.

Approach : Use two pointers and a set to identify longest substring with unique characters.
We will need a current length, longest string length, head and tail pointer(i and j).
Two pointers implementation usually uses tail pointer as outer loop.
Head pointer is used when some condition is invalid, in this problem's case. The invalid case is when a non unique variable is seen in the current substring. Increment the head pointer until the condition is valid again.

Time : O(n)
Space : O(1) if not counting string to character array pointer.

17. Letter Combinations of a Phone Number

Approach : Create a 2d array map that contains the character set for each phone number. Make a function that retrieves the character set for an INT. Create a recursive function that solves the problem when visualizing the problem as a tree that branches off into a new leaf for each character combination. When the final recursive call or tail of the phone number is reached, add the answer to the answer.

Time: O(3^n x 4^m) where n is the number of digits in the input that maps to 3 letters. M is the number of digits in the input that maps to 4 letters.  n+m is the total number of digits in the input.
Space: O(3^n x 4^m) since one has to keep 3^n x 4^m solutions.
